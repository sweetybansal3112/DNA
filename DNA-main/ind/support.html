            <p>
                Groups of various kinds and NGOs (non-governmental organizations also known as non-profit organizations)
                have long been a bedrock for queer and lgbtqia+ culture in India. Queer/lgbtqia+ groups in India come in
                many forms and operate under various organizational structures: some are social and/or support groups
                with several regulars who act as conveners and may help provide structure by, for example, setting
                conversation topics for each week's meeting; other groups identify specifically as "collectives" perhaps
                to reflect certain aspects of their organization or particular socio-political commitments such as to
                shared work; still, other groups are more freewheeling, and, while they congregate under a group name,
                do not seem to have a designated leader, though there are members who are "moderators" of the group's
                Facebook group. The language that groups and individual members use to talk about and label genders and
                sexualities also vary. Some prefer LGBT, LGBTQIA+, or a similar acronym, while others prefer queer,
                which some see as linked to a politics of intersectionality and/or inclusion, and some use lgbtqia+ and
                queer interchangeably. To acknowledge each position, this section uses both simultaneously, joined by
                either "and" or a slash. When it is clear that a group or individual prefers a specific term, that
                language will be used.</p>
            <p>
                Such groups and NGO spaces provided—and still provide—indispensable social spaces for queer/lgbtqia+
                people, perhaps because, at least until quite recently, other publicly accessible social or meeting
                spaces geared towards queer/lgbtqia+ people (such as bars) did not exist. Some bars and cafes are more
                frequently known to be "queer-friendly" rather than catering specifically—if not almost exclusively—to
                queer/lgbtqia+ people in the way that gay bars are in some other countries; several such examples are
                Kitty Su, the LaLit hotel chain's swanky night club chain, and Q Café in New Delhi, which recently
                closed down in 2019.
                Some queer/lgbtqia+ groups follow a nomadic style, meeting periodically at different coffee shops,
                restaurants, book shops, and similar public areas. Others have a fixed meeting spot—often the offices of
                an NGO.</p>
            <p>
                Public visibility and understanding of queerness and lgbtqia+ experiences is increasing rapidly in
                India—particularly during and after the more recent Delhi High Court (2009) and India Supreme Court
                rulings (2013 and 2018) toggled back and forth the legality of IPC (Indian Penal Code) section 377. The
                Supreme Court's final ruling, in September 2018, read down section 377 to legalize, between consenting
                adults, what is generally referred to as "homosexual sex"—although the precise wording of section 377
                outlawed "anal intercourse against the order of nature." Nonetheless, queer and lgbtqia+ groups remain
                an indispensable central axis of queer sociality—alongside several secret and/or private Facebook
                groups, some of which correspond to social and support groups that periodically meet in the physical
                world (or IRL—in real life—to use internet terminology).
                The sections below list, and provide information about, queer and lgbtqia+ groups, businesses, and
                notable figures. These lists are not intended to be comprehensive, and at the end of each section is a
                list of additional queer and lgbtqia+ groups around India. The section concerning groups includes
                several that are now defunct but whose contribution to lgbtqia+ culture in India is significant as the
                groups shaped the lgbtqia+ community while they existed—and after.

                bunch of workshops as well so do keep a check on their social media handles and website for the same.
